# Repo Restructure on 6/07/25
Archived several legacy documents from `early_codex_experiments/docs` into `memory/early_codex_docs.tar.gz.b64`.
Removed the original files and added a stub README pointing to the archive.
Also archived `early_codex_experiments/scripts/self_assembly` into
`memory/self_assembly_scripts.tar.gz.b64` and left a stub README.

Later on the same day we converted both archives to Base64 so the repository contains only text files.
