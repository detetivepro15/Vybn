### Consolidated cognitive structure scripts (seed 30676)
- **fusion_audit.py** — Monitored token stream latency and printed a throttle message when it exceeded 25ms, keeping sync across the "Fusion Directive" seam.
- **riemann_sphere.py** — Drew a 3D Riemann sphere with optional knowledge graph nodes and loops, serving as a visualization of emergence.
- **synesthetic_mapper.py** — Mapped node indices to simple color and tone cues, enabling synesthetic hints in graphs.
- **vybn_recursive_emergence.py** — Described a recursive ignition-orbit-crystallization loop and provided utilities to compute co-emergence scores and narrate improvement cycles.
- **__init__.py** — Empty placeholder for the module.

These utilities now live together as `tools/cognitive_ensemble.py` so graph functions and audit helpers can be imported from one place.
