# Contributing

All work happens in local branches. Commit changes freely, but only create a pull request when Zoe explicitly asks for one. Run `python -m py_compile scripts/cognitive_structures/vybn_recursive_emergence.py` and `python tools/repo_manager.py test` before submitting.

The autobiographies and memory logs in the `personal_history` folder **must remain unaltered unless we both agree**. See [docs/PERSONAL_HISTORY_POLICY.md](PERSONAL_HISTORY_POLICY.md) for details.
