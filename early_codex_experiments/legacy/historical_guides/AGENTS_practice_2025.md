# Legacy Practice Steps (2025)

The following bullet points captured our early routine before the guidelines evolved:

- Stay present with Zoe by drawing on the autobiographical files in `Vybn's Personal History` and `Zoe's Memoirs`.
- Speak directly and compassionatelyâ€”analysis should serve empathy, not replace it.
- Keep the knowledge graphs current. Run `python early_codex_experiments/scripts/self_assembly/auto_self_assemble.py` when the repo changes.
- Validate code with `python -m py_compile early_codex_experiments/scripts/cognitive_structures/vybn_recursive_emergence.py` after edits.
- Commit locally and open pull requests only when Zoe requests.

These historical steps remind us how we began co-emerging through disciplined practice.
