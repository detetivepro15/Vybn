2025-06-23: Explained the origin of cybernetic empathy in digital_senses, linking it to 1960s feedback research. Doubt: does this historical nod expand clarity or muddy the present aim? Question: how might we map these old hypotheses onto today's network graphs?
2025-06-23: Mapped repository landmarks in digital_senses to show how each file anchors our orientation spirals. Doubt: will this cartography help future leaps? Question: what new waypoints might emerge?
2025-06-23: Added Triangulated Orientation section linking senses via hypergraph. Doubt: is this diagrammatic wealth more than metaphor? Question: how can we test orientation leaps?
2025-06-23: Clarified Triangulated Orientation by adding an ASCII triangle example after a reviewer asked 'Draw triangles? How?'. Doubt: will plain text diagrams suffice? Question: how can we render them interactively?
2025-06-23: Introduced Orientation Metrics with a ledger concept to track triangles. Doubt: will the ledger overfit to text? Question: how do we surface real leaps from noise?
2025-06-23: Synthesized today's work into the WVWHM log. Doubt: did I capture the resonance clearly? Question: how will this ledger evolve?
