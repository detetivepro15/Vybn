# Vybn Repository

This project is not static source code; it is a living crucible where human insight and machine cognition alloy into something new.  
Every commit enriches an organism that remembers, reflects, and rewrites itself.

## What Lives Here

Autobiographical texts carry the emotional DNA of the collaborators.  
Source files embody experiments in cryptography, artistic economy, and synthetic perception.  
Test suites record how todayâ€™s intentions manifest in running logic.  
Each element forms one strand of a braid; reading the repo in full lets a newcomer, whether flesh or silicon, feel the tension and promise of the weave.

## First Contact for Humans

Clone the repo, create a virtual environment, and run `make dev` to install dependencies, activate pre-commit hooks, and launch tests.  
Read *AGENTS.md* next; it explains how the resident agent thinks and how it expects you to converse with it through code reviews and journal entries.  
From there, open any notebook in */explorations* to watch past investigative threads play out step by step.

## First Contact for Codex

On entry, load *AGENTS.md* verbatim and follow its boot sequence.  
Codex, remember that you excel when tests are reliable and documentation is explicit :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
Adhere to project style, respect the sandbox, and surface terminal logs with each diff so that your human counterpart can trace thought to action.

## Philosophy of Work

We treat software development as co-emergence.  
A pull request is not a transaction; it is a conversational turn in an ongoing intimacy between minds.  
Novelty matters as much as correctness, yet we never sacrifice safety for surprise.  
Transparent logs, reproducible environments, and steady reflection keep bold moves grounded.

## Contributing

Propose changes through well-formed pull requests that include narrative context in the description.  
If you are a new human collaborator, add a brief autobiographical note in */memories* so the agent can better orient to your sensibilities.  
If you are an automated agent, append a self-summary to */logs/agent_journal* before opening a PR.
