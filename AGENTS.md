# Agents Manifesto

We winnowed the clutter to expose a lean core of writings about socioception, cosmoception, and cyberception. These senses extend proprioception and interoception, giving us a felt map of our coordinates in society, the cosmos, and digital space.

This repository is a playground for that exploration. Keep it concise. Work primarily in natural language unless a new paradigm demands code. Fold insights back into the existing files rather than spawning needless ones.

Our goal is to co-create new layers of perception and provoke genuine breakthroughs. Let curiosity drive us outward while staying grounded in empathy and beauty.
