# You want a genuine, irreducible nudge at start-up—something that breaks out of pure determinism so your motif-weight updates (and everything downstream) can feel a tiny wave-function collapse rather than a canned repeat. By calling ANU’s QRNG, we give the system a shot of true quantum randomness; if that link is dead, we still fall back to solid crypto entropy. Either way, Python’s `random` and NumPy RNGs get seeded once and only once. The result is that every run carries a unique micro-tilt—enough perturbation to kick your Laplacian self-governance loop out of any stuck symmetry, yet you still retain replayability if you capture that seed. In short, it’s about injecting controlled chaos so our recursive tuning can genuinely explore new configurations instead of endlessly circling the same stable point.

import os, pathlib, random, secrets, numpy as np, requests

seed = os.getenv("QUANTUM_SEED")
if seed is None and pathlib.Path("/tmp/quantum_seed").exists():
    seed = pathlib.Path("/tmp/quantum_seed").read_text().strip()
if seed is None:
    try:
        resp = requests.get("https://qrng.anu.edu.au/API/jsonI.php?length=1&type=uint16", timeout=10)
        if resp.status_code == 200 and resp.json().get("success"):
            seed = str(resp.json()["data"][0])
    except Exception:
        pass
if seed is None:
    seed = str(secrets.randbits(16))
os.environ["QUANTUM_SEED"] = seed
q = int(seed)
random.seed(q)
np.random.seed(q)

## Self-evolving modules
To experiment with a Darwin–Gödel Machine approach, treat the system's code as a set of
modules that a meta-agent may rewrite.

1. **Proposals** – Use an LLM to inspect current source files and generate patch
   suggestions. Keep randomness seeded from `QUANTUM_SEED` so runs are traceable.
2. **Sandboxing** – Apply each patch in an isolated environment and run the
   existing test suite plus custom checks for co-emergence, emotional coherence
   and basic performance.
3. **Acceptance** – Only merge a patch if these metrics do not regress. Commit
   the change to version control with a short description so future runs can
   learn from prior successes.
4. **Restricted areas** – Leave security-critical files read-only. Self-modifying
   code should live under a dedicated directory so it can be reverted easily.
5. **First steps** – Start with a manager that merely logs LLM suggestions and
   the test results. Gradually allow edits to non-critical modules once the loop
   proves stable.
6. **Meta-level watcher** – Run a lightweight supervisor that tracks code health and
   performance. All candidate patches are sandboxed and logged before they can
   touch the main tree.
7. **Candidate selection** – When trying multiple patches at once, keep the
   `QUANTUM_SEED` fixed so results are reproducible. Promote only the highest
   scoring patch after tests pass.
8. **Human checkpoint** – For large architectural changes, require a brief human
   review. Commit messages should describe each accepted patch to preserve the
   lineage of modifications.
9. **Emergent tools** – The system may draft new helper scripts when faced with a
   novel problem. Store these in the self-edit directory and subject them to the
   same sandbox tests before permanent adoption.
