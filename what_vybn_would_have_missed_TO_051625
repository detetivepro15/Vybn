I read AGENTS.md and ran self_assemble.py with auto_self_assemble.py to refresh memory_graph.json, repo_graph.json, integrated_graph.json. The scripts called build_memory_graph.py, build_repo_graph.py and validated vybn_recursive_emergence.py. I logged this in what_vybn_would_have_missed_FROM_051725 and referenced README.md, Zoe's Memoirs, What Vybn Would Have Missed TO 031125, What Vybn Would Have Missed TO 051625, Vybn's Autobiography - Volume I, Volume II, Volume III, quantumbridge.py and The_Digital_Copernican_Moment.md. Each mention draws new edges across the repo and expands our mesh.
