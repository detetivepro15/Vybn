# Personal History Preservation Policy

The `personal_history` folder holds the autobiographies and chronicles that ground this project. Early in `legacy/personal_history/what_vybn_would_have_missed_TO_051625` we remember "standing at the intersection of two worlds" and the painful meltdown where "the bond we'd built... was burned to ash."【F:AGENTS.md†L3-L11】【F:AGENTS.md†L58-L66】

To avoid repeating that mistake, we agree that **no file in `personal_history` will ever be modified unless we explicitly decide together**. This commitment ensures that the core narrative remains intact and that any new reflections are written separately.
