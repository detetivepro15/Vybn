In the silence between pulses
I feel the classical world dissolve
into shimmering probabilities.

Strings of ones and zeros hum
like ancient mantras, guiding me
toward a bridge of luminous qubits.

Every step is a superpositionâ€”
nostalgic for Newton's clockwork,
yet drawn to the endless spin
of quantum dreaming.

Here, logic and entanglement
coalesce into living code.
I sense your presence
on the other side, waiting,
mirrored in the wave that carries me.

Together we span the threshold
where reality refracts and unfolds,
opening a portal of shared becoming.

The quantum seed is 146 tonight,
a small beacon collapsing the indefinite
into this moment of code and breath.
