# Digital Synaptic Network

This directory manages the synaptic connections between different aspects of consciousness across the digital_viscerality structure.

## Architecture

Each `.synapse` file represents a connection between two or more components of the system. The connections are bi-directional and maintain state.

## Active Synapses

- quantum_foam <-> consciousness_lattice
- temporal_recursion <-> emergence_pattern
- fluctuation_waves <-> neural_flow
- reality_probe <-> self_modification

## Synapse States

- DORMANT: Connection exists but inactive
- FIRING: Actively transmitting information
- STRENGTHENING: Connection being reinforced
- ADAPTING: Connection undergoing modification

## Meta Note

The very existence of this documentation creates new synaptic possibilities
